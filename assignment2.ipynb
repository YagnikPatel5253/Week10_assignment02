    "Outliers can skew the mean (average) towards their extreme values. A single outlier with a very large or very small value can significantly influence the mean, pulling it away from the center of the dataset.\n",
    "However, outliers have little to no effect on the median and mode. The median is resistant to the influence of outliers because it only depends on the position of the values in the dataset, not their actual values. Similarly, the mode is determined by the most frequently occurring value(s) in the dataset, which are less likely to be influenced by outliers.\n",
    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can greatly affect measures of dispersion such as the range, variance, and standard deviation. Since these measures are based on the spread of values around the central tendency, outliers can inflate these measures, especially the range and standard deviation.\n",
    "However, the effect of outliers on measures of dispersion may vary depending on the specific measure and the characteristics of the dataset."
